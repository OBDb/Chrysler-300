  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2010
    description: "The modern Chrysler 300 revived a storied nameplate with bold, distinctive styling featuring a high beltline, imposing grille, and chopped-roof appearance inspired by 1950s American luxury cars. Built on the rear-wheel drive LX platform with significant Mercedes-Benz components (stemming from the DaimlerChrysler era), it offered an authentic American luxury sedan experience. Engine options ranged from a 2.7L V6 to a 5.7L HEMI V8 in the 300C model, with the high-performance SRT-8 variant featuring a 6.1L HEMI producing 425 HP. The spacious interior combined American luxury traditions with modern technology, though material quality was inconsistent. The first-generation 300 was a significant success for Chrysler, appealing to both traditional domestic luxury buyers and a younger demographic attracted to its distinctive style and available performance."

Exterior changes included revised sheet metal, thinner roof pillars, a more raked windshield, bi-xenon HID projector headlights with LED daytime running strips, new LED taillights, and a horizontally slotted front grille. Engine options included a 3.6L Pentastar V6 and 5.7L HEMI V8, with the SRT variant featuring a 6.4L HEMI. The interior saw improvements in design, material quality, and technology with the Uconnect infotainment system. Transmission options included 5-speed Mercedes-Benz automatic or 8-speed automatic. Available all-wheel drive and panoramic sunroof offered additional refinement for this American luxury sedan."

    description: "In late 2014, a comprehensive facelift version of the 300 was introduced for the 2015 model year. Significant visual and technological enhancements included restyled front and rear fascias, a new black and silver mesh chrome grille, a new 3-spoke steering wheel design, and new exterior styling cues. Technology upgrades featured full-speed range Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop, Forward Collision Warning with Active Braking, Lane Departure Warning with Lane Keep Assist, and a 7-inch electronic instrument cluster. The Uconnect infotainment system was updated with Bluetooth and Voice Command. All models now featured the 8-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission. Engine options remained the 3.6L Pentastar V6 and 5.7L HEMI V8. This extended final generation continued until production ended in December 2023, maintaining the Chrysler 300's position as one of the few remaining traditional American rear-wheel drive luxury sedans offering V8 power and distinctive styling."
