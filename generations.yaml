  - name: "First Modern Generation (300C)"
    start_year: 2005

    description: "The modern Chrysler 300 revived a storied nameplate with bold, distinctive styling featuring a high beltline, imposing grille, and chopped-roof appearance inspired by 1950s American luxury cars. Built on the rear-wheel drive LX platform with significant Mercedes-Benz components (stemming from the DaimlerChrysler era), it offered an authentic American luxury sedan experience. Engine options ranged from a 2.7L V6 to a 5.7L HEMI V8 in the 300C model, with the high-performance SRT-8 variant featuring a 6.1L HEMI producing 425 HP. The spacious interior combined American luxury traditions with modern technology, though material quality was inconsistent. The first-generation 300 was a significant success for Chrysler, appealing to both traditional domestic luxury buyers and a younger demographic attracted to its distinctive style and available performance."

  - name: "Second Modern Generation"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The second-generation 300 maintained the distinctive styling of its predecessor but with more refined details, including a less upright grille and more sculpted body sides. Still based on an evolved version of the LX platform, it continued to offer rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive configurations. Engine options initially included a 3.6L Pentastar V6 and 5.7L HEMI V8, with the SRT variant (discontinued in North America after 2014) featuring a 6.4L HEMI. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, incorporating Chrysler's Uconnect infotainment system with an 8.4-inch touchscreen. A significant refresh in 2015 updated the exterior styling and interior technology, while subsequent years brought incremental updates to keep the model competitive. Special editions in later years, including various appearance packages and the high-performance 300C with a 6.4L HEMI for the final model year, maintained interest in the aging platform. Throughout its extended production run, the second-generation 300 maintained its position as one of the few remaining traditional American rear-wheel drive sedans, offering V8 power and distinctive styling in an increasingly homogenized market. Production ended in 2023 without a direct replacement, marking the conclusion of Chrysler's flagship sedan as the brand transitions toward electrification."
